## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Among the latest trending bank apps in Nigeria presently is the Kuda Bank app. Created as an online-only bank without any physical branch has made it stand out to most people, especially the Nigerian youths. The Kuda Bank is one of the most well-designed fintech companies in Nigeria, packed with unique features that make it an excellent replacement for the conventional Nigerian banking system.

The bank is designed especially for smartphone users. You can open an account within few minutes, track your spending, save more, and make the right money moves. The idea of Kuda is to ease Nigerians from the frustrations they experience with the regular banks, hence the slogan - “the bank of the free”. You get a debit card for free, send money with no charges, and receive yearly interest when you save automatically.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
